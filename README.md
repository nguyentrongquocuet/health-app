# Scenario assumptions

## Scenario 1: Anonymous user

Can only access the landing page

## Scenario 2: Authenticated user

Allow viewing all pages including Top page, My Record, Landing page

# Technical dependencies:
- Typescript
- ReactJS
- TailwindCSS
- React-router
- Styled-components
- Highcharts.js

# Solution
## Styling
I skip to the end with `TailwindCSS` ðŸ˜„

I found some inconsistency in the design that includes typography, spacing unit hence itâ€™s not very convenient  to define CSS class for all of them, itâ€™s when `styled-components` comes in to play. Follow that path, every component has its own typography styles, and in some cases its own irregular sizes/spacing. `twin.macro` is also a good choice to mix up Tailwind and CSS but the node version Im using is not supported.
The app shall not be responsive

## Mock data
Mock data will be generate in runtime using `faker`, and I will use Promise to implement mock api. Im not focusing on api specifications, mock data for lists will change entirely when refetch new page, that's why you'd see different data set each time you hit `Load more`. Mock data is just for demonstrating how the UI works.

# Typography:
There are 2 fonts: 
- Hiragino Kaku Gothic Pro for most of the text(Japanese texts)
- Inter: for date, number, for English texts

# Known issues
- Bundle size is too large(422kb after gzip)
- No API error handling
- The app is not responsive
- The chart in home page wouldnt switch to the `year` range after first load

# Dev env:
Node.js: 16.13.1
