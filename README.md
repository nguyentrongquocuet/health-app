# Technical dependencies:
- Typescript
- ReactJS
- TailwindCSS
- React-router
- Styled-components
- Highcharts.js

# Solution
## Styling
I skip to the end with `TailwindCSS` ðŸ˜„

I found some inconsistence in the design that includes typography, spacing unit hence itâ€™s not very convenient  to define CSS class for all of them, itâ€™s when `styled-components` comes in to play. Follow that path, every component has its own typography styles, and in some cases its own irregular sizes/spacing. `twin.macro` is also a good choice to mix up Tailwind and CSS but the node version Im using is not supported.
The app shall not be responsive

## Mock data
Mock data will be generate in runtime using `faker`, and I will use Promise to implement mock api
